# 1. Preliminary tasks
Make sure you have the basic platform in place (i.e. Linux server).
Or, set-up a new LAMP system, if you don't have one already.
A Tutorial can be found here: https://wiki.debian.org/LaMp

# 2. rsyslog configuration
In most new Linux distributions, rsyslog comes installed as the default syslog.
By default rsyslog logs to files.
You must configure it to log to a Database instead, for vrsyslog to work.

Ubuntu example:
$>sudo apt-get install rsyslog-mysql

- Suggestion: use dbconfig to automatically create the DB and tables.
When asked "Configure database for rsyslog-mysql with dbconfig-common?", answer YES, to use the default configutation.
You will be asked for the "Password of the database's administrative user:" (your DB admin password)
Then, you will be asked for "MySQL application password for rsyslog-mysql:" (suggestion "vrsyslog")
And "Password confirmation:" (suggestion "vrsyslog")
Remember the password you define for rsyslog-mysql (default user: "rsyslog", default password: "vrsyslog")

- Manual configuration (ONLY NEEDED if you do NOT use dbconfig to automatically configure the DB and tables):
You will need the createDB.sql file located in vrsyslog/resources directory.
$mysql <./resources/createDB.sql
$mysql -u root -p
mysql> CREATE USER 'rsyslog'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'vrsyslog';
mysql>GRANT ALL ON Syslog.* TO 'rsyslog'@'localhost';
mysql>exit

Make sure rsyslog is working properly and logging to the DB.
You can do this either from the CLI (mysql>), or phpMyAdmin.
You should see entries in the SystemEvents table in the Syslog DB.
Example:
$ logger testing123 (generate a test log message)
$ mysql -u rsyslog -p
Enter password: vrsyslog
mysql> USE Syslog
Database changed
mysql> SELECT id FROM SystemEvents limit 1;
+----+
| id |
+----+
|  1 |
+----+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

Now that rsyslog is properly logging to the DB, you can install and use vrsyslog.


# 3. Install and configure vrsyslog
Untar vrsyslog.tar.gz and make the 'public_html' folder accesible from the web.
NOTE: Make sure the assets and protected/runtime dirs are writable by the webserver process.
(a quick fix could be: sudo chgrp www-data assets)

Congifure your desired user name and password and any other DB settings if needed, by editing the configuration file (public_html/protected/vrsyslog.ini).
